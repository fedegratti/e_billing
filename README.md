# e_billing
The E-Vader's billing system.

##Instalation:

Just like any rails app ;)

Clone this repo, open a terminal on the repo's folder and run the following commands:

1: Install all the gems we need.
 `bundle install`

2: Create the db.
`rake db:migrate`

3: (optional) Insert some seeds.
`rake db:seed`

And that's it!

Just run rails using  `rails s`

Enjoy!
